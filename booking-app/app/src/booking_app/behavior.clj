;; While creating new behavior, write tests to confirm that it is
;; correct. For examples of various kinds of tests, see
;; test/booking_app/test/behavior.clj.

;; You'll always receive a message with the type msg/init when your
;; app starts up. This message will include a :value key with the
;; value of the :init key from your dataflow.

;; Once this behavior works, run the Data UI and record
;; rendering data which can be used while working on a custom
;; renderer. Rendering involves making a template:
;;
;; app/templates/booking-app.html
;;
;; slicing the template into pieces you can use:
;;
;; app/src/booking_app/html_templates.cljs
;;
;; and then writing the rendering code:
;;
;; app/src/booking_app/rendering.cljs
